Easterly Chess

Introduction
------------

What follows is a conversation between Peter and James regarding Object Oriented and East Oriented
Design. Along with the discussion is a Chess program developed with OO and East in mind. We hope
this project and discussion is of use to you.

More information on the East Oriented approach can be found [here](http://jamesladdcode.com/?p=12)
as well as various other places on the [internet](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=save+google+search&oq=save+google+search#q=East+Oriented+code).

tehniques has been elided.

The Discourse
-------------

Hello Mr. Ladd,

My name is Peter DiSalvo. I'm a non-professional programmer from New York. I'm wondering if you could spare some time to help me with an object-oriented programming problem.

I found your "East Oriented Code" technique while researching the concept of "Tell, Don't Ask". It's a brilliant clarification of "Tell, Don't Ask" and I'm glad to have found it. However, I'm still having trouble applying the concepts.

I've been working on a personal project to enhance my OO coding skills. The ultimate goal is to build a chess program, but I aimed to experiment with object-oriented programming along the way in hopes of attaining a new level of understanding. "Tell, Don't Ask", or "East" is the style of code that I've been aiming for, but can't seem to make it work.

After months of experimentation, and reading many books and blogs, I've managed to work my way into a worse state. Everything I write ends up an untestable disaster. I've started from scratch countless times. I can't seem to find a way to focus my designs. I can't tell which messages objects should be sending and to which objects. I'm at the point where I can't even get a hundred lines of code out without creating a mess and throwing it away.

I was hoping maybe we could talk a bit about my issue. Maybe you could point me in the right direction. I would greatly appreciate any time you could spare.

Thank you for your time,

> I'd be happy to correspond with you on OO and East as long as you are ok with me responding when I can - pretty busy right now.

> My first rule of Object Oriented Design is to concentrate on behaviour and not on the state (fields/variables) inside Objects.
> These fields and state fall out from defining the behaviour.

> What is your starting point - the Chess Board?
